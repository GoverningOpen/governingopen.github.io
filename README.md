# Open Source Governance Workshop

This repository contains materials (guides, exercises, etc) for open source projects looking to tackle various governance challenges. It is structured so that organizers can run workshops at meetups and conferences to introduce these resources to open source teams. We believe that by learning about how past projects have tackled problems, we can avoid unnecessary stress and cultivate happier, more functional communities.

The repository is structured around **Governance Challenges** which are specific challenges that recur across many different projects. These include, but are not limited to:

* Figuring out what kind of governance you have
* Making decisions about what tasks to work on
* Deciding on and establishing community norms
* Raising and/or distributing money
* Cultivating new leaders from among the community

Some of these challenges may not seem like pure "governance challenges", but we believe that governance plays a vital role in how these situations develop and thus how they need to be addressed.

For each challenge identified, we seek to collect exercises, tools, wisdom and anecdata that can help future projects tackle these challenges. As we develop this knowledge base, we hope to identify which approaches are most helpful in a given context so we can make recommendations with more confidence. In the end, though, there is never "one right way" to address a governance problem. All we can do is make our best guess.

# Ways to Contribute

## Suggest a new challenge

We use our issue tracker to discuss [new challenges](https://github.com/shaunagm/Open-Source-Governance-Workshop/labels/new%20challenge). Anyone is welcome to suggest a challenge, but please check for duplicates first. Please select the [new challenge issue template](https://github.com/shaunagm/Open-Source-Governance-Workshop/tree/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE) when prompted.

## Flesh out a challenge

Once a challenge has been accepted, we need to add a corresponding Markdown file in the repository. It should copy [this basic template](https://github.com/shaunagm/Open-Source-Governance-Workshop/blob/main/challenge_template.md). Please try to include any existing resources that have been shared in the corresponding issue thread.

## Add a resource to a challenge

Each challenge's Markdown file has a section labeled **Resources**. These are exercises, tools, stories, etc that projects can learn from. You are always welcome to add new resources to an existing challenge. In rare cases you may want to add the same resource to multiple challenges; in this case, reach out to the community for help, as you will likely want to customize the explanatory text for the resource to fit the challenge it is meant to help with.

## Organize a workshop

The Open Source Governance Workshop series is being piloted at PyCon US 2023, and there has been interest in having it at other events. If you would like to bring the workshop series to a meetup or conference, please reach out. We are also happy to work with individual projects.

## Fund this work

This workshop series is being funded by a small carve out from an NSF grant. If you are interested in funding further development of this work, please reach out.
