Title: Determining Your Existing Governance
Authors: Shauna Gordon-McKeon
Summary: How do you know what your current governance even is?


Many projects, including smaller and newer projects, do not have any sort of explicit, formal governance. This is not always a problem, but it can be confusing to newcomers or even existing community members. It can also be a barrier to collaboration with potential partners who want to understand who they're dealing with and assess if they're reliable.

Signs that a project is running into this problem include:

* the maintainer feels overloaded, because while other community members are willing to do things, they don't feel empowered to help
* the community wants to grow or transition the project, but is confused about how decisions should be made
* the community wants to work with a partner or accept money from someone who requires them to have explicit governance

The goal of determining your existing governance is not to map out how you would *like* your community to work. It's about writing down how your community currently functions. That said, if you are inspired by this process to make changes, that's great too!
