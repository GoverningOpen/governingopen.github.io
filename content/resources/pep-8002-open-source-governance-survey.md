Title: The Open Source Governance Survey (PEP 8002)
Challenge: determining-existing-governance, transitioning-governance
Summary: A survey of open source governance models conducted during Python's 2018 governance transition.


In 2018, as part of Python's governance transition from a BDFL model with Guido van Rossum at the helm to the project's current governance, Barry Warsaw, ≈Åukasz Langa, Antoine Pitrou, Doug Hellmann and Carol Willing submitted [PEP 8002](https://peps.python.org/pep-8002/). 

This PEP is a detailed overview of the governance structures of other open source projects, specifically [Rust](https://peps.python.org/pep-8002/#rust), [OpenStack](https://peps.python.org/pep-8002/#openstack), [Jupyter](https://peps.python.org/pep-8002/#jupyter), [Django](https://peps.python.org/pep-8002/#django), [TypeScript](https://peps.python.org/pep-8002/#typescript), [AstroPy](https://peps.python.org/pep-8002/#astropy) and [Microsoft](https://peps.python.org/pep-8002/#bonus-microsoft) (Microsoft is, obviously, not an open source project, but was included as a helpful counterexample.)

This PEP is a helpful guide for larger projects looking to formalize or transition their governance. Smaller projects will likely find the structures described "too much".
