                    <p>Shauna Gordon-McKeon, the maintainer of this site, provides consultations to open source projects and organizations
                    facing governance challenges. The first consultation is free â€” you can <a href="https://cal.com/shauna-gordon-mckeon/governance-consult">
                    sign up here</a>.</p>
                    
                    <p>Shauna also works with foundations, conferences, meetups and other open source organizations to provide governance resources to
                    their member projects. If you would like to host governance workshops or office hours to your members, please contact
